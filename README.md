# Simple development environment in Windows
> Prerequisites: Docker Desktop

## How to run the first time
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## How to use
The container should begin every time we open Docker Desktop.

Then you can just attach a terminal by using the Docker Desktop app!

> Alternatively you can use the following command in a Windows terminal : `docker exec -it dev-env bash`

## How to use my Windows files?
Just put the dev-env folder inside your "Projects" folder.

Then you have all your projects inside the container!
